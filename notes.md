## Next up:

- Add tests.

- Deploy on Heroku.

- Add date created to snippetSchema as "date":

## For Hard Mode:

- add session to test ownership
- add "star" feature to DB
- -- could be as simple as adding stars: [username, username, username]
- add sorting feature for front-end display of snippets



## current issues
- how to preserve new snippet input formatting (indentation)
- for some reason z-index fix for inputs works on view.mustache but not index.mustache
- no support for multiple tags entered at once
- are new users adding new snippets properly in front-end?
